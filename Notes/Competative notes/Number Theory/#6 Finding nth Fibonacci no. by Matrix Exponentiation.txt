Finding nth Fibonacci 

>> [F1			F2] X	 [P			Q] = [F2 			F3]
>> 				    [R			 S]

>> In the above equation the sencond term is the tramsiation metrix and the value of the P, Q, R, S is given below: 

>> F1*P+F2*R = F2							P = 0		R = 1

>> F1*Q+F2*S = F3							Q = 1 		S = 1 

>> [F1			F2] X	 [0			 1](n-1) = [Fn 			Fn+1]
>> 				    [1			 1]

>> then return Fn ,the nth term

>> that it.

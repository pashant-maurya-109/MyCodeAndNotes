Modular Arithmetic

>> #define congurent =  (=-)

>> Modular Congruencs:
	1 >if a =- b (mod N)
	2 >then a-b =- 0 (mod N)
	3 >[a-b is divisible by N]
	4 >
	5 >if a*b = c
	6 >then 
	7 >a(mod N)*b(mod N) =- c(mod N)
	8 >and N can be any Integer
	9 >[note :- this also work for addition and subtraction]
	10 >
	11 >..

>> [part :- 2]

>> Check divibility by 9 and 3

>> sum the all the digit of the given number 
>> and then take mod with 9 and 3 
>> if the mod is then that number is divisible by 9 and 3

>> Exponentiation in modular arithmetic 
>> if a=- b (mod N) then
>> a^K =- b^K (mod N) 

>> this si changed

Modular GCD

>> Approach:-

>> if you need to calculate GCD(x,y) where X is a very  huge number but y is smaller then we would find potential GCD candidates and apply modulo arithmetic to find GCD

>> eg GCD(427498742937874923,90) = ?

>> so, potential Candidates would be divisors of 90 
>> that is 1,2,3,5,9,10,15,18,30,45,90

>> we can calculate A^n % D [D is a potential candidate of B]

>> (A^N + B^N)%D = 0 [In this expression we can't calculate A^N so , for that we use modular Arithmatic]

>> we can the above expression in this form:
	1 >(A^N+B^N)%D = (A^N%D + B^N %D)%D

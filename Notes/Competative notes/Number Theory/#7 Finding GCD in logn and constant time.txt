GCD of Two Numbers in O(logn) or O(C)

>> Approch to solve :
	1.1 >To answer the query L  R
	1.2 >Let
	1.3 >
	1.4 >NOTE :- that, this comes form here:
			3.1 >gcd(x1,x2,x3,x4,x5....xn) = g1
			3.2 >and gcd(1y,y2,y3,y4,y4 .....ym) = g2
			3.3 >
	1.6 >GCD of elements 1 to L-1 = g1
	1.7 >GCD of elements R+1 to N = g2
	1.9 >Then
	1.10 >ans of query L R = gcd(g1 , g2)

Total Divisors

>> find total of divisors from prime factotization of a number N

>> Example :
	1 >N = 300;
	2 >N = 2x2x3x5x5;
	3 >Total divisors = 18
	4 >..

>> Motivation for this problem:
	1 >Given a Nunber's prime Factorization. find total number of divisor and print it modulo 10^9+7

>> Problem Approch:
	1 >prime factorize the number and 
	2 >take the power of prime factors after adding 1 into it and 
	3 >multiply them all,
	5 >eg Total divisors = (2+1)*(1+1)*(2+1)
	6 >..

>> Why above Approch works:
	1 >so let we create a array which has powers of all prime factors in which just subtract 1 from all and write them like fellow
	2 >like this : [1,0,2] [refered by above eg]
	3 >so i create a diviser form it then 
	4 >d = 1 * 1 * 25 will divide the 300
	5 >how d  comes ooh it really easy
	6 >you can take 2 atmost 2 time and 3 atmost 1 time and 5 atmost 2 times
	7 >if you don't select a factor then take 1 in that place
	8 >you can take less times the factors
	9 >so again create d = 4 * 3 * 5 = 60 will divide the 300 
	10 >..

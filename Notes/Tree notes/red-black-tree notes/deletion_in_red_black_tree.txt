########### NOTE :- we can not delete middle nodes we can delete leaf nodes , we can only replace the middle nodes 
>> we have two method to delete nodes in red black tree 
>1. inorder Predecessor  
>2. inorder successor

>>>steps to delete nodes 
>>step 1 : perform bst deletion
>>step 2 
: case a :- if node to be deleted is red just delete it

: case b :- if root is db(double black) ,just remove db

: case c :- if db's sibling is black , is both its children are black 
:: if case 3 occure then, 
>>for remove db
>1 add black to irs parent
>>1.1 if parent is red it becomes black
>>1.2 if parent is black it becomes double black 
>2 make sibling red
>3 if still db exites , apply other cases

: case 4 :- if db'sibling is red 
>1 swap colors of parent and its sibling 
>2 rotate parent in db dirtection
>3 reapply cases

: case 5 :- db's is black , sibling's childeren is far from db is black ,but near child to db is red
>1 swap color of db's sibling and siblings child who is near to db
>2 rotate sibling in opposite direction to db 
>3 apply case 6

: case 6 db:s sibling is black , far child is red
>1 swap color of parent in db's derection

Avl tree
>> it is a Bst
>> |height of left suntree| - |height of right subtree| = {-1,0,1}
>> above difference is a balance factor
>> whenever you insert a element in avl tree you must check the balance factor(bf)
>> if the balance factor is not in the above set then you need perform rotations accordingly (like bf is 2 then you need two rotation)
>> while the rotation tree must be a bst tree after rotation
>> and ther are 4 type of rotation (LL,RR,RL,LR)
>> thats it, for this lacture

Heap in c++

>> heap is a kind of stack 

>> it not has a fixed size

>> 'new' operator is used to allocate memory in heap

>> eg : int *p = new int() :
	1 >this is not directly store into the heap 
	2 >it first store in the stack as a pointer ,
	3 >and that pointer points to the memory location in which the our data is stored 
	4 >..

>> 'delete' keyword :
	1 >it is used to delete variable from heap
	2 >this delete the variable from the heap but,
	3 >this will only deleted the variable from the heap not from the stack,
	4 >the pointer in the stack is still present pointing to the deleted value
	5 > this kind of pointer also know as 'Dangling pointer'
	6 >eg startcode
	int *p = new int();
	*p = 10;
	
	delete(p);
	7 >
	8 > for good practice : it is nessccary to reuse and to another variable in the heap or remove it from stack
	9 >for deleting an array :
		1 >delete []Array_name;
		2 >
	10>for delete an variable :
		1 >variable_name = NULL
	11>
	12 >Why we use delete?:
		1 >because, we don't delete the variable from it cause memory likage problems speicly in server 
		2 >and other device where the they don't terminate the programs

Representation of Graph

>>  Adjacency matrix:
	1 >In it we create a matrix of space N^2
	2 >then we do entre all the in that matrix
	3 >eg if there is connection between 1 to 2
	4 >then entry will like this 'graphArr[1][2] = 1' 
	5 >we will make all connection by 1
	6 >
	7 >Problems with Adjacency matrix method:
		1 >it take to much space of N^2
		2 >BFS or DFS traversal is of order O(N^2) which is too slow
		3 >Adding a new node is not easy

>> Adjacency list:
	1 >In it we create an arr of linkedList(you can choose any dynamic linear ds except stack and queue)
	2 >space is twice of edges in graph
	3 >entry ' i ' to ' j 'preformes like this:
		1 >'arr[i].push(j)'
		2 >
	4 >..

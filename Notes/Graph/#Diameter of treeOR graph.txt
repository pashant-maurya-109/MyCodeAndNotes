Diameter of Tree

>> it is defined as the longest path between any 2 nodes in the tree

>> how we can calculated it ?:
	1 >Novice Approach:
		1 >we would run DFS , n times
		2 >In each iteration ,we would set ith node as root and find distance of farthest node
		3 >running time : O(N^2)
		4 >..
	2 >Better Approach:
		1 >we can find diameter is only 2 DFS run
		2 >
		3 >take any arbitrary node as root and run dfs from it and find the farthest node , let this node be x
		4 >
		5 >run a dfs from node x and find the maximum distance from this node to any other node , this distance is diameter.
		6 >case 1 (Root on the diameter):
			1 >let's assume : Farthest Node Y is not one of the end points.

Connected components in Graph

>> what are connected components ?:
	1 > a connected component is a set/pair of vertices which contain a path between them
	2 >a single node is itself a connected component
	3 >
	4 >In the directed graph :
		1 >there can be more then 1  connected components
		2 >connected in this graph is know as strongly connected components
		3 >..
	5 >In the undirected graph :
		0 >
		1 >there is only connected component
		2 >connected in this graph is know as weakly connected components
		3 >
	6 >
	7 >..

>> Counting number of connected components:
	1 >it we use dfs
	2 >first we start traversal from a node for n node
	3 >we again call traversal for those nodes how are left in the previous traversal
	4 > it goes same untill all nodes are visited..

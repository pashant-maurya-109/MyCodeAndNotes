Bipartite graph 

>> Bipartite graph also know as bigraph special graph such that you can divide the vertex set into 2 disjoin sets such that :
	1 >each vertex belongs to exactly one of the sets
	2 >each edge connects vertices of 2 differen sets
	3 >..

>>  Bipartite graph test:
	1 >startcode

	//this function check whether this graph is bipartite graph or not
	bool dfs(int v,int c){
		//c is color and it neither 0 or 1
		// these arr decleared in graph class
		vis[v] = 1; 
		col[v] = c;		
		for(int child : arr[v]){
			if(vis[child] == 0){
				if(dfs(child,c^1)==false){
					return false;
				}
			}else{
				if(col[v] == col[child]){
					return false;
				}
			}
		}
		return ture;

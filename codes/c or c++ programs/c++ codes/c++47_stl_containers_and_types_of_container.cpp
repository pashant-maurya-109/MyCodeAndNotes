//        random acces is fast ,
//        insertion/deletion is slow but,

//    list (for my remender linkedlist,arraylist),
//        random acces is slow ,
//        insertion/deletion is fast but,
//        insertion at the end is fast ,

// dequeue

// associative container : (direct access it includes following) his is all operation in fast except rendom access
//    set/multiset, map/multimap
// derived container (this provides real world modeling it includes following) his time complexcity is depend on dataStructure
//    stack ,queue ,priorty queue
